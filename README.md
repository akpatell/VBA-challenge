# Aim of project 
   This project is a demonstration of my Visual Basics skillset thus far in the Data Analytics certification program.
   The following are the objectives of this assignment:
    
To create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
   The ticker symbol
   Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year (for each set of stock ticker)
   The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year (for each set of stock ticker)
   The total stock volume of the stock (for each set of stock ticker)
    
Once the above script is successful for one sheet, the script is formatted to then loop through all the three worksheets: 2018, 2019, 2020

# Folders
   Images - This folder contains screenshots of each sheet in the "220624_Multiple_year_stock_data" Excel workbook to give you an idea of what the final result should      look like
   
   Resources - This folder contains the "220624_Multiple_year_stock_data" Excel workbook as well as the VBA script "220624_alphabetical_testing_longlong" that was used      to run the script
    
   There will be two buttons upon openign the Excel workbook:
        "Click me to run the script!" - This will run the script for you
        "Click me to clear!" - This will clear the workbook contents for you
